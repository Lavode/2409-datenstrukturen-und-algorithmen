\section*{Exercise 1}

All measurements were performed on a notebook with an Intel i7-7500U CPU @ 2.7 GHz.

\subsection*{Runtime of insert-sort}

As seen in the graph below, runtime of insert sort has grown rougly
exponentially with rising number of samples to sort. This matches well with the
theory, namely its worst- and average-case complexity of O($n^2$).

\subsubsection*{Estimate of runtime for bigger sample sizes}

With its runtime complexity of O($n^2$), the runtime of this algorithm can be
expressed as $t = c * n^2$ for a given constant $c$. This allows us to estimate
this constant based on measurements taken.
\\

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
	\hline
	Sample count & 10000 & 30000 & 50000 & 1000000 & 300000 & 500000 \\
	Runtime [s] & 0.026 & 0.145 & 0.372 & 1.511 & 14.379 & 44.486 \\
	c ($ * 10^{-10}$)& 2.6 & 1.61 & 1.49 & 1.51 & 1.60 & 1.78 \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\\

In order to minimize the impact of timing inaccuracies - as well as other
sources of variance - influencing the measurements with fewer samples, we used
a weighted average to calculate the constant, using the number of samples as a
weight. This leads to a weighted average of $1.69 * 10^{-10}$.

Using this constant, the runtime to sort 10 million samples can be estimated to
be in the range of 16900 seconds - roughly 4h 42min.

\subsection*{Runtime of merge-sort}

As seen in the graph below, runtime of merge sort has grown rougly linearly
with rising number of samples to sort. While we would expect slightly
faster-than-linear growth due to its worst- and average-case complexity of O($n
* log(n)$), that difference is hard to observe for relatively small sample
sizes - made worse by the inaccuracies introduced due to the way execution time
was measured.
