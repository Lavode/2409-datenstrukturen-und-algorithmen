\section{Number of items in interval}

Let \texttt{input} = $[x_1, ..., x_n], x_i \in \{1, ..., k\}$

We start by preparing two arrays which will be used to determine the number of
items in a given interval in a later step.

\begin{verbatim}
	occurences = []
	less_than  = []

	for i = 1 to k:
	  occurences[i] = 0
	  less_than[i] = 0

	for i = 1 to n:
	  occurences[input[i]] += 1

	for i = 2 to k:
	  less_than[i] = less_than[i - 1] + occurences[i - 1]
\end{verbatim}

Clearly, the first and last loops have a time complexity of $\theta(k)$, while
the middle loop has a complexity of $\theta(n)$. As such, the preparation step
has a time complexity of $\theta(k + n)$.

Now we can calculate the number of items in the interval $[a, b]$ as:
\begin{verbatim}
	less_than[b] - less_than[a] + occurences[b]
\end{verbatim}

\section{Stability of sorting algorithms}

Implementations of insertion sort will usually be stable, since they will sort
left-to-right, moving each to-be-sorted item right-to-left until the first spot
it can fit into.
\\ 
Implementations of merge sort will usually be stable, due to - during the
merge phase - iterating over all blocks, as well as over all items within each
block - in one direction.
\\
Heapsort will not be stable, as the initial stage - where the heap is created -
will not preserve relative ordering of elements. That is, a heap provides
absolute order, but does not preserve relative one.
\\
Quicksort will not be stable, as each phase only ensures that the position of
elements relative to the pivot is correct - but makes no guarantee about the
position of elements relative to each other.

\subsection{Making unstable algorithms stable}

Comparison-based unstable sorting algorithms can be easily made stable - at the
cost of additional memory and processing time - by extending the sorting key by
the position of the item in the original input list. That is, to use the item's
original position as a 'tie-breaker' in case of items which are equal based on
their sorting key.
