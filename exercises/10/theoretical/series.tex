\section{Change-making}

\subsection{Greedy algorithm}

We define the following naive algorithm

\begin{itemize}
	\item Let $A$ be empty array.
	\item Let $amount$  be amount of change which to hand out.
	\item While $amount \neq 0$
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Let $c$ be coin with biggest denomination so $c \leq amount$
			\item Append $c$ to $A$
			\item $amount := amount - c$
		\end{itemize}
	\item Return $A$
\end{itemize}

In words - starting with the biggest denomination, use as many of that coin as
possible, then move on to the next smaller denomination. Continue until
requested amount is met.

\subsubsection{Optimal substructure}

We intend to show that an optimal solution for a given problem also contains
optimal solutions for its subproblems.

Let $a$ be the amount for which to hand out change, let $f(a)$ be the number of coins
of the ideal solution for amount $a$.

Assume $x = f(a)$ for a given $a$. Further assume that there exists a coin $c$
in the optimal solution.

This implies that the given solution for amount $a$ also contains a solution -
with $x - 1$ coins - for amount $a - c$.

If this solution to the subproblem were not optimal, then there would exist a
solution - with $y < x - 1$ coins - for amount $a - c$. This would, however,
imply that there would also exist a solution with $z < x$ coins for amount $a$.

As this is a contradiction to the original assumption, we have shown that the
problem has an optimal substructure.

\subsubsection{Greedy choice property}

By differentiating the following four cases, we can show that - in any step of
the iteration - the coin picked by our algorithm will be part of the ideal
solution.

Let $amount$ be the amount of change which to hand out.

\begin{description}
	\item[$amount \geq 25$] The optimal solution is guaranteed to cointain at least one coin with denomination $25$.
	\item[$25 > amount \geq 10$] The optimal solution is guaranteed to contain 1 -- 2 coins with denomination $10$.
	\item[$10 > amount \geq 5$] The optimal solution is guaranteed to contain exactly one coin with denomination $5$.
	\item[$5 > amount \geq 1$] The optimal solution is guaranteed to contain 1 -- 4 coins with denomination $1$.
\end{description}

As such, the choice our algorithm makes is guaranteed to be part of the optimal
solution.

\subsection{Coin systems where greedy algorithm fails}

One example, where our greedy algorithm fails to produce the optimal solution
is the following:

Let our coin system cointain the following denominations: $N = (1, 3, 4, 5)$

When trying to find optimal change for $n = 7$ cents, the algorithm would come up
with $(5, 1, 1)$, whereas the optimal solution would be $(4, 3)$.

The same issue will arise with eg $N = (25, 10, 1)$, $n = 40$.

\subsection{Change-making via dynamic programming}

Let $N = (c_1, c_2, \dots, c_k)$ be our coins.

We define the list containing number of coins in the optimal solution as follows:
\[
	c(j) = 
	\begin{cases} 
		\infty & j < 0  \\
		0 & j = 0 \\
		\min_{x \in \{1, 2, \dots, k\}} 1 + c(j - c_x) & \text{else}
	\end{cases}
\]

At the same time we use $denom(j)$ to keep track of the denomination of a coin
used to create the ideal solution for amount $j$. This can be tracked easily
within implementations generating the table above, by setting $denom(j) = c_j$
for those cases where we set $c(j) = 1 + c(j - c_x)$, ie those cases where a
better solution is found when considering an additional coin.

These two lists can be created with a time-complexity of $\theta(n * k)$.

Having created those two lists, calculating the optimal solution for a given
amount $n$ is as easy as looking at $denom(n)$, adding said coin to our
solution, setting $n = n - denom(n)$, and repeating while $n > 0$.

Illustrating the above as a recursive function:
\begin{lstlisting}
	change(j, denom):
	  if j > 0:
	    return [denom[j]] + change(j - denom[j], denom)
\end{lstlisting}
